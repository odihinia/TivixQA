2- Coutry selection typo - "Germainy" instead of "Germany"

3- You can chose a city not in it's respective country, and only the city selection matters, the coutry automatically updates to the city's respective country

4- the "model" input field doesn't seem to do anything. (It doesn't filter out any models, like it's supposed to)

5- Location: Poland, Wroclaw - This is not what i chose earlier in bug 3: i chose france/wrocław. Also, the display should read Wrocław, Poland instead (because that is the convention of naming cities)

6- the # field (number of car?) is not ordered at all. It also should update dynamically. (Unless it's an orderID system - then it should incorporate more data to make it more expandable and better for SELECTing with ID in SQL)

7- The date being incorrect (i.e 1st date being after the 2nd, going back in time) should automatically block the user from sending that data to the API. Theres no front-end handling of it right now.

8-ValueError at /time data '23123-12-31' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d' - you can manually input a bad date. Somehow the date picker works correctly when you input a 5 number or more year.

9- Not sure if bug or just slow API for the demo page, but i kept getting "too much load" at the first click. Maybe just a server issue
